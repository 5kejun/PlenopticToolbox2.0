# PlenopticToolbox2.0
The Plenoptic Toolbox 2.0 aims to help promote research using Focused Plenoptic Cameras (a.k.a. Plenoptic 2.0), 
providing a dataset of real and synthetic images.

It also provide a python library to work with such images (in particular with Raytrix images at the moment).

The code is completely open source and can be integrated and further developed for research projects.
